# Simon-Game
The Simon Game project is a simple yet interactive memory challenge game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game requires users to reproduce a sequence of colors that becomes progressively longer with each successful level. The project combines user interface design and logical sequence management to create an engaging gameplay experience. The goal of this project was to apply frontend development skills to create a functional, responsive, and visually appealing web-based game.
